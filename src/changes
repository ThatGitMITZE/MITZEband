Changes in MITZEband v0.0.official:

-------------------------------------------------------

To do:

* Add new player races, monsters, etc.

* Further limit approaches based on scumming for infinite healing

* Modify player Filthy Rags to discourage grindy play

* Try to reimplement damage display for innate attacks on possessors
(this will be a major pain...)

------------------------------------------------------

Known issues:

* If the last monster in a quest is a pink horror, the quest counts as
completed on the pink horror's death, even though blue horrors will appear

* The item inspection menu sometimes doesn't offer floor items as an option
even when there is a floor item that could be inspected

* Use-ID of some effects, at least Identify and *Identify*, is occasionally
buggy for mysterious reasons

* Dark squares previously illuminated by a light-carrying monster sometimes
appear to remain inappropriately lit

* Items and stairs can co-exist on a square in some very unusual situations
